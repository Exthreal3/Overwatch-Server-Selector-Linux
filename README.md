# Overwatch-Server-Selector-Linux
 A simple PyQt application for blocking Overwatch 2 server IP addresses

# Dependencies
This application requires that you have iptables and PyQt installed.
 1. Install PyQt ```pip install PyQt```
 2. ```sudo apt-get install iptables -y```

# Usage
Currently I have not created any file structure to be used on other machines, and this only works on my machine; I will get around to changing this soon.
